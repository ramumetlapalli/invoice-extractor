# Project Description: Invoice Extractor

Invoice Extractor is an intelligent tool designed to automatically extract key information from invoices, regardless of the language used. It goes beyond simple data extraction—allowing users to ask questions directly, such as “What is the total amount?” or “When is the due date?”, and receive accurate answers in real-time.

This project leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) with **Google Gemini models** to interpret invoice content dynamically, making it a powerful solution for multilingual and complex document processing. Whether it’s identifying amounts, dates, or vendor information, Invoice Extractor simplifies invoice management and provides fast, reliable insights on demand.
